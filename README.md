# java_library_management
In this project, in the second year of my higher education, I implemented library management with various functions and methods through which it is possible to interact with books in one way or another. I also implemented my own data structure for working with the library.


DataStructure - in this file you can find my implementation of my own data structure for managing the library.

Library - Represents a library containing a collection of books as a class, with all the methods.

Main - some examples of how to use my library and its methods
